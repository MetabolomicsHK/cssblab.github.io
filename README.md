#Computational & Statistical Systems Biology Laboratory

Our mission is to develop computational and statistical solutions for the analysis of high-dimensional molecular data in various context of biomedical research. In the past we have focused on bioinformatics method development in the area of computational proteomics, and our topics are rapidly growing into other areas now, including

    Proteogenomics approaches for multiple molecular data integration
    Bioinformatics tool development for un-targeted metabolomics and proteomics data
    Interactive data visualization
    Data analysis for clinical application of high-throughput technologies

We are located at MD1 building (NUS) and the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology (Proteos, Biopolis), with the lab members operating in both locations for collaborative research projects.
